# About
This project is a small proof of concept to showcase the use of asynchonous searching using Javascript XMLHttpRequest/ PHP & MySQL.
For a bit of fun a Theme for Mass Effect was used to create an Allience database.

# JavaScript
Client side asynchronous XMLHttpRequest was used to allow for realtime searching without the use of additional buttons or forms, loaidng data as the user enteres information into the search box automatically.

# PHP
PHp is mainly being used to create a basic search queiry for the specific purpose of the project, a connection class is used to generate a SQL connection and disconnection when needed.

# MySQL
The initial part of the project was to learn more about SQL with insert sleeps and UUID's, this can be seen in the DDL file under the scripts folder.

Each new record inserted into the databaseis given a universally unique Id and at times may have insert breaks of several seconds.

# Future Plans
If the time is available, I would like to focus my efforts on finialising a CRUD system for this project to allow users to create their own records, read the new record, update available records and delete records all without refreshing the page.
